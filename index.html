                                        signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                                        thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
                                        completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer

                            structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to
                            enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
                            curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
                            assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next
                            level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews
                            as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
                            after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
